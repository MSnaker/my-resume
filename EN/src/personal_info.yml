short description:
  AIV Software Engineer with a Master's Degree in Aerospace Engineering from University of Padua and international experience at RWTH Aachen. Possessing a solid grasp on physical phenomena, I excel at both direct problem-solving and methodical evisceration of complex challenges. My experience forged me to obtain consistent results and I give my best in a collaborative team. I strive for continuous learning, and that means I am in a perpetual journey of improvementâ€”sometimes learning something new, sometimes honing my current skills.
