					<h2>ABOUT</h2>
					<!-- about you -->
          <p> 
              Aerospace Engineer with a software-focused career. After a brief excursus, promoting automation in Zanardi Fonderie, now filling the position of Test Software Engineer in D-Orbit, to develop software that automates the AIT (assembly, integration and Testing) phase of ION, the company's Orbital Transportation Carrier and its main LOB. In my spare time I like to tamper with my phone software, installing this or that custom ROM in place of old plain Android Stock, or designing a 3D printable object to make my everyday life easier.

							Python password generator | 2021 
							<pop class="tooltiptext">
								Python script with GUI to obtain an n-letters password from a previously encrypted text, subdivided in sections. The script is meant to adopt an algorythm easy to replicate mentally with the correct source on hand, so that it is not essential to have an electronic device.

						</h3><br>
						<h3 class="tooltip">
							Master Thesis "Design of a coupling surface as alignment aid to an androgynous interface | 2020"
							<pop class="tooltiptext">
								Work conducted within the iBOSS project of RWTH Aachen, which developed an architecture to build modular satellites. 
								<br>The surface designed is mounted around iSSI, an androgynous interface found in each side of the iBOSS modules, to allow mechanical coupling and exchange of power and data between them. The surface's function is to loosen the strict tolerances previously required for the coupling.

						</h3><br>
						<h3 class="tooltip">
							Bachelor Thesis "Carbon Nanotubes in the Aerospace Sector"
							<pop class="tooltiptext">
								Literature analysis and reelaboration on the different applications of carbon nanomaterials (particularly carbon nanotubes) within the Aerospace sector.
