					<h2>ABOUT</h2>
					<!-- about you -->
          <p> 
              Aerospace Engineer with a software-focused career. After a brief excursus, promoting automation in Zanardi Fonderie, now filling the position of Test Software Engineer in D-Orbit, to develop software that automates the AIT (assembly, integration and Testing) phase of ION, the company's Orbital Transportation Carrier and its main LOB. In my spare time I like to tamper with my phone software, installing this or that custom ROM in place of old plain Android Stock, or designing a 3D printable object to make my everyday life easier.

						<h3 class="tooltip">
							Master Thesis "Design of a coupling surface as alignment aid to an androgynous interface" | 2020
							<pop class="tooltiptext">
								Loosen the alignment tolerances required by androgynous coupling interfaces, through the design of a 3D circular surface that acts as a guide for the interfaces' reciprocal approach, and also performs a function of mechanical coupling against shear forces between the interfaces themselves.  
								<br>Work conducted within the iBOSS project of RWTH Aachen, which developed an architecture to build modular satellites.
