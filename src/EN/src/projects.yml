  - name: Python password generator
    period: 2021
    description: >
      Python script with GUI to obtain a password from a previously encrypted source text.
      The script is meant to adopt an algorithm easy to replicate mentally with the correct source on hand,
      so that it is not essential to have the tool at hand, to obtain a password.

  - name: Master Thesis
    period: 2020
    description: >
      Title: Design of a coupling surface as alignment aid to an androgynous interface
      
      Loosen the alignment tolerances required by androgynous coupling interfaces, through the design
      of a 3D circular surface that acts as a guide for the interfaces' reciprocal approach, and also
      performs a function of mechanical coupling against shear forces between the interfaces themselves.
      
      Work conducted within the iBOSS project of RWTH Aachen, which developed an architecture to build modular satellites.

  - name: PC Tower Shelf
    period: 2021
    description: >
      Sheet metal design of a custom shelf for my Personal Computer. The shelf adapted to the desk structure, 
      and was supported at its free edge by two steel cables, which also kept the PC tower from oscillating.
