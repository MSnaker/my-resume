        <p>
            I am Marco Bissaro, I graduated in October 2020 from my MSc. in Aerospace Engineering at University of Padua. Other than the main subjects in my study curriculum, I also approached Elements of Automatic Controls, Electrical actuators, and Vibrational mechanics. After my studies I have been working in process automation, first in the Machining Department of a foundry, then in a Satellite Design and Manufacturing company, focused mainly on the New Space.

            What my curriculum doesn't show is the pleasure I have always found in learning: I can proudly say that I have enjoyed all and every one of the subjects I faced during my studies: although they might have been at some times difficult, I never really felt any weight associated with them. <br>
            This advantage perhaps stems from my curiosity, which I deem my best and most defining quality. Evidence of this is my focus that, after the scientific studies, moved to literary and artistic matters (history, classic and foreign literature); nothing, however, prevents all natural phenomena I see from forcing me to consider their physical causes. <br>
            I face excercise (both physical and mental) with enthusiasm, enjoioying myself more, the more it proves challenging, and a certain feeling of personal integrity makes it very difficult for me to leave things half-way throughâ€”starting from books and series, to concrete life commitments. 
        </p>

            I recently discovered a new pleasure in DIY by doing some customisations to my studying/gaming setup: I added a physical switch to my PC to switch the input between two Hard Disks (one dedicated to study/work, the other to games and entertainment), and I am constantly designing objects to ease my life at home (mostly  3D-printed, but I dared with a sheet metal object, once, and it paid off).
            <br>In university, I gained a very satisfying control on my work-life balance, thanks to the 1h commute that stands between my hometown and the city where I studied. This also serves as a proof that, while I have some attention span issues, I am aware of them and I know how to prevent and compensate them. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Right now, the prospect of a new job is appealing not only from a work standpoint (as I am, in some respects, satisfied with my current position), but also because of the transformation it would bring to my life: to move away from home it meant to take full responsibility and control over my life, and who knows what a job change would require from me.
