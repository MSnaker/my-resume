        <p>
            I am Marco Bissaro, and in October 2020 I graduated from my Master's Degree in Aerospace Engineering at University of Padua. In my study curriculum, other than the main subjects, I also had Elements of Automatic Controls, Electrical actuators and Vibrational mechanics.

            What my curriculum doesn't show is actually the pleasure I have always felt in learning: I can proudly say that I have enjoyed all and every one of the subjects I faced during my studies. Moreover, although recent experiences have stirred some regrets in me for the lack of sociality due to my commuting to and from the campus, I never really felt any weight associated with studying. <br>
            This advantage stems from my curiosity, which I deem my best and most defining quality: as a proof of this my focus, after the scientific studies, moved to literary and artistic matters (history, classic and foreign literature); that does not prevent any natural phenomenon I see from calling for me to analyse its physical causes. <br>
            I face challenges with enthusiasm (especially those that turn out hard to overcome) and some feeling of personal integrity makes it very difficult for me to leave things half-way done&#8212;starting from books and series, to concrete life committments.
