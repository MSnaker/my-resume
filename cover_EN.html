        <p>
            I am Marco Bissaro, I graduated in October 2020 from my master’s degree in Aerospace Engineering at University of Padua. In my study curriculum, other than the main subjects, I also had Elements of Automatic Controls, Electrical actuators, and Vibrational mechanics. 
        </p>
        <p>
            What my curriculum doesn't show is the pleasure I have always found in learning: I can proudly say that I have enjoyed all and every one of the subjects I faced during my studies. Although recent experiences have stirred some regrets for my almost nonexistent social life—I commuted to and from the campus—my studies might have been at some times difficult, but I never really felt any weight associated with them. <br>
            This advantage perhaps stems from my curiosity, which I deem my best and most defining quality. Evidence of this is my focus that, after the scientific studies, moved to literary and artistic matters (history, classic and foreign literature); nothing, however, prevents all natural phenomena I see from forcing me to consider their physical causes. <br>
            I face challenges with enthusiasm (especially trying ones) and a certain feeling of personal integrity makes it very difficult for me to leave things half-way through—starting from books and series, to concrete life commitments. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I recently discovered a new pleasure in DIY by doing some customisations to my studying/gaming setup: I added a physical switch to my PC to switch the input between two Hard Disks (one dedicated to study/work, the other to games and entertainment), and I am studying a mechanism to transform my desk into a standing desk when I need to. Both solutions can be led back to my tendency to create sealed compartments between work and life, which gave excellent results during University. <br>
            This also serves as a proof that, while I have some attention span issues, I am aware of them, and I am always willing to take uncomfortable compromises if they lead to personal improvement. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Right now, the prospect of a new job is appealing not only from a work standpoint (as I am, in some respects, satisfied with my current position), but also because of the radical transformation it would require in my life: to move away from home I will have to take full responsibility and control over my life, and this is a chance I am not willing to miss.
