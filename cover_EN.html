        <p>
            I am Marco Bissaro, and in October 2020 I graduated from my Master's Degree in Aerospace Engineering at University of Padua. In my study curriculum, other than the main subjects, I also had Elements of Automatic Controls, Electrical actuators and Vibrational mechanics.

            What my curriculum doesn't show is actually the pleasure I have always felt in learning: I can proudly say that I have enjoyed all and every one of the subjects I faced during my studies. Moreover, although recent experiences have stirred some regrets in me for the lack of sociality due to my commuting to and from the campus, I never really felt any weight associated with studying. <br>
            This advantage stems from my curiosity, which I deem my best and most defining quality: as a proof of this my focus, after the scientific studies, moved to literary and artistic matters (history, classic and foreign literature); that does not prevent any natural phenomenon I see from calling for me to analyse its physical causes. <br>
            I face challenges with enthusiasm (especially those that turn out hard to overcome) and some feeling of personal integrity makes it very difficult for me to leave things half-way done&#8212;starting from books and series, to concrete life committments.

            I recently discovered a new pleasure in DIY by doing some customisations to my studying/gaming setup: I added a physical switch to my PC to change the boot between two Hard Disks (one dedicated to study/work, the other to games and entertainment), and I am studying a mechanism to transform my desk into a standing desk when I need to. Both solutions lead back to my tendency to create sealed compartments between work and life, which gave outstanding results during University. <br>
            This also serves as a proof that, while I have some attention span issues, I am aware of them and I am always willing to take uncomfortable compromises in exchange for personal improvement.

            At the moment, the prospect of a new job is appealing not only from a work standpoint (as I am, in some aspects, satisfied with my current position), but also because of the radical transformation it would require in my life: to transfer away from home I will have to take full responsibility and control over my life, and this is a chance I am not willing to miss.
