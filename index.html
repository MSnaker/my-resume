					<h2>ABOUT</h2>
					<!-- about you -->
                    <p> 
						I am a young Aerospace engineering graduate, and a passionate&#8212;if only with little professional experience&#8212;coder/programmer. I am looking for a position where I can put both of these aspects in action: the activities I enjoy are those that require translating physical phenomena into code, but also solving simple or common problems through a coding approach.<br>

							Python password generator | 2021 
							<pop class="tooltiptext">
								Python script with GUI to obtain an n-letters password from a previously encrypted text, subdivided in sections. The script is meant to adopt an algorythm easy to replicate mentally with the correct source on hand, so that it is not essential to have an electronic device.

							Master Thesis "Design of a coupling surface as alignment aid to an androgynous interface | 2020"
							<pop class="tooltiptext">
								Work conducted within the iBOSS project of RWTH Aachen, which developed an architecture to build modular satellites. 
								<br>The surface designed is mounted around iSSI, an androgynous interface found in each side of the iBOSS modules, to allow mechanical coupling and exchange of power and data between them. The surface's function is to loosen the strict tolerances previously required for the coupling.

						<h3 class="tooltip">
							Bachelor Thesis "Carbon Nanotubes in the Aerospace Sector"
							<pop class="tooltiptext">
								Literature analysis and reelaboration on the different applications of carbon nanomaterials (particularly carbon nanotubes) within the Aerospace sector.
